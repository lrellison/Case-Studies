## Data source found at (https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit)

# Prepare

Guiding questions
● Where is your data stored? - Downloaded from Kaggle
● How is the data organized? Is it in long or wide format? - Organized using ID of the user in long format
● Are there issues with bias or credibility in this data? Does your data ROCCC? [Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current, Cited]
  - Data is reliable in that it was extracted from the smart device without human error though not a large sample size so could be biased since only from 30 users who consented to share data
  - Data is a public dataset posted online with credible acknowledgements so would believe it is original
  - As dataset contains second/minute/hour, daily and covers sleep, activity, heartrate, weight, calories and all the areas tracked by their fitbits it is comprehensive
  - The data is from 2016 so it is now 5 years ago so not the most current data but has been cited and confirmed.
● How are you addressing licensing, privacy, security, and accessibility?
  - Since the data is part of public domain and publicly posted it is usable when cited
● How did you verify the data’s integrity? - Looked into the original post and acknowledgements then checked some of the csv's for how the data is arranged.
● How does it help you answer your question? - Dataset shows when users are actively wearing their device
● Are there any problems with the data?

Key tasks
1. Download data and store it appropriately.
2. Identify how it’s organized.
3. Sort and filter the data.
4. Determine the credibility of the data.
